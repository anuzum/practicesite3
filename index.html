							<p>I live in Vienna, VA with my two daughters and husband. We used to have a black lab, but he passed away several months ago. His name was Milo and he was the best dog in the world. Somehow, my children have convinced me to get another dog. We have to get a hypoallergenic dog this time because my youngest daughter and my husband have a low-level dog allergy. My daughter never exhibited symptoms around our black lab because he was older than both of my children and she was desensitized to his allergens. Majority rules and the name of the dog will be "Bear."</p>

  <h2>Previous Education</h2>
  <p id="first-paragraph">My education journey has been a bit long and circuitous, but it has made me the person I am today! I am grateful to be in school again.</p>
  <h2>Education Journey Continued</h2>
  <p>I earned my bachelor of arts degree at The College of William and Mary, and while I started out wanting to major in English, I ended up majoring in psychology with a minor in sociology. I then earned my master of arts and educational specialist degrees in counseling psychology from James Madison University. I am now back to English, my original passion and interest, and am happy to be pursuing my graduate degree <a href="https://english.gmu.edu/programs/la-ma-engl-lit" target="_blank">in English literature</a> at George Mason University.</p>

  <h1><b>EXPERIENCE</b></h1>
  <h2>Beginning (Phase 1)</h2>
  <p id="exp-first-paragraph">I started out my career in psychology research. After earning my first graduate degree, I worked in the field of counseling, specifically with the foster care community.</p>
  <h2>Middle (Phase 2)</h2>
  <p>I then took a career break when I had my children. I quit my job during my maternity leave. Something about becoming a parent made me feel brave enough to want to take risks and think about what I really, truly wanted to do. During my time as a stay-at-home parent, I took on various volunteer roles in which I pursued what I love: writing and editing.</p> 
  
  <p>While volunteering and reflecting during my career break, I realized what my ultimate goal was: to return to the field of English, work as a writer/editor, and pursue a graduate degree in English Literature.</p>
  <h2>Current (Phase 3)</h2>
  <p>I did debate about whether to go back to school full-time and earn my graduate degree first before going back to work, but I decided to get a job first and then pursue the degree. Because of that decision, I am now busier than I have ever been in my life and barely have time... <em>ever</em>. This has made me extremely intentional with my time and helped me prioritize the things that matter the most to me. Part of this journey has been quitting social media--in doing so, I gave myself hours of my day back and realized I had the capacity to instead prioritize activities that bring my life value and meaning. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6AF_aFuD8w" target="_blank">Here's a video</a> about the perks of not using social media in case you are interested!</p>

<section id="shorttermgoals">
  <h2 class="sparkly-text">Short-Term Goals</h2>
  <p id="goals-first-paragraph">For my <em>very</em> short-term goals, I'd like to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Figure out HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>Finish this course successfully</li>
    <li>Create a website for my kids for fun!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My current short-term goals are to continue to work full time as an editor for a government contractor while I finish my master's degree in English literature. Given that I am taking one class at a time, this may take me until the summer or fall of 2027.</p>
  <p>In my current professional role, I aim to continue to polish and develop advanced editing techniques and skills while taking on challenging proposals and tasks. I hope to be growing professionally within my organization and taking on additional responsibilities.</p>

	<br>
	<section>
	<h2 class="sparkly-text">Long-Term Goals</h2>
	<p>Long term, my vision is to continue to write so that one day, I can publish a book. I am currently workshopping ideas and have several ideas for children's and young adult books.</p>
	<p>In order to make this goal a reality and not just something I have been talking about for decades, <em>I need to carve out more time to write daily</em>. It is difficult to work on this goal because I feel that my <a href="#shorttermgoals">short term goals</a> are taking up all of my time. I found <a href="https://medium.com/@penguinrandomus/how-to-write-a-novel-and-keep-your-day-job-2cd9b520fe0" target="_blank">this article</a> about writing regularly to complete a novel very helpful and hope to apply these suggestions. </p>
	<p>I also began writing a novel in my Novel class that I took in the Spring of 2024 with Professor Ngalabak, and I hope to continue writing that as well. I hope I do not add that to my pile of unfinished writing.</p>

	<p>My favorite part is doing the research and citing examples to prove my thesis. I love how the essay always somehow comes together, despite feeling impossible at the beginning. It is <em>very</em> satisfying to make links and connections and come up with new ideas as I write!</p>
